CV Builder uses locale storage to store the users input to create a resume page for their needs. 

Before login to the CV Builder, the user should have a clear idea about his or her resume content. User must have a clear idea about their input and their personal details. I would recommend the users to upload a high-definition profile image with the compressed size of 2 Mega Bits. CV Builder doesn’t store or collect any personal information from the users. CV Builder recommend the users to read CV Builder’s Terms of use and Privacy policy to know more about the data handling and management.
